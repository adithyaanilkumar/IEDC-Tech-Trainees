          <h2>Top Bookish Confessions</h2>
          <p>
            We've all got them, haven't we? Those little reading quirks, the
            books we didn't like but everybody else loved, the pages we dog-ear.
            Some of us even read the last page of a book first (which is totally
            wrong!). I thought it'd be fun to share my fifty bookish
            confessions... <br />1. I’ve never read a classic novel.<br />
            2. It’s the cover that draws me in to most books. If I don’t like
            the cover, chances are I won’t choose to read the book inside.
            Harsh, but true.<br />
            3. I shed a tear at books which aren’t even meant to be sad. So hand
            me a book that is meant to make me cry and… <br />4. I was once the
            only blogger at a book launch where the publicist for some reason
            told everyone there, whilst introducing me, that I’d read and
            reviewed all these books I hadn’t even heard of. I spent the rest of
            the evening awkwardly discussing these books I ‘loved’ but didn’t
            actually know existed.<br />
            5. I love collecting paperbacks but I prefer reading ebooks.<br />
            6. The first book signing I ever went to was Harlan Coben’s. I was
            so nervous but he was lovely, and afterwards I tweeted a photo of me
            with the book he signed for me which won me a mountain of his
            previous books, signed, which in turn won me masses of brownie
            points from my mum.<br />
            7. I’ve never loaned a book from a library. I like owning books, I’d
            never be able to give one back.<br />
            8. I sacrificed my wardrobe for more book storage. Priorities.<br />
            9. I’ve skipped two book launches because by the time I got to my
            hotel, I was too engrossed in my books to put them down. (The Memory
            Book and Three Amazing Things About You).<br />10. I don’t often
            re-read books but I’ve re-read Beyond Grace’s Rainbow by Carmel
            Harrington about ten times because I loved it that much. <br />11.
            My favourite type of books are actually psychological thrillers but
            I’ve found most of this year’s psychological thrillers a bit
            disappointing. <br />12. I daren’t count but I own well over a
            thousand unread books. <br />13. I can’t read more than one book at
            a time. <br />14. Up until about two and a half years ago, I barely
            read a thing. If it wasn’t for my mum so animatedly discussing the
            books she was reading with me, and treating me to a book every time
            we went shopping, I’d probably be doing something much less
            rewarding now. Like socialising. <br />15. I try not to ever give up
            on a book and rarely do, even though I know I should.<br />
            16. I hate being asked what my favourite book is, or who my
            favourite author is. How long have you got? <br />17. I hate any
            sign of damage on my paperbacks. I spend 50% of the time reading
            them trying to barely turn the pages or the spine, so they look near
            perfect when I’m finished.<br />
            18. Most of my book shopping is done online unless I spend a couple
            of days in London, where I end up bringing home around ten or
            fifteen new books. One of my London shopping trips...<br />
            19. I always carry my Kindle and a paperback with me, even if I’m
            only going to the shop and know for sure I won’t have chance to read
            either. <br />20. I struggle to read when I’m travelling because I’m
            so easily distracted.
