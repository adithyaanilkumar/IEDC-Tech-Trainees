#For evaluators

This is a small website for a library.

This project is completely done using HTML and CSSwithout any frameworks. Becuse it was only the time when I just started learning basic web designing for this project.

But afterwards I learnt JavaScript, Bootstrap, NodeJs and much more. But now I feel that this project is really too small so along with this I am also attatching the link to my portfolio so please do check that too if you don't mind

##Why this project?

I'm added this project because I thought that prevoius project was not upto the mark as if I was in a hurry learning and doing it.
 But now I had learn many new and advanced things in web development including backend. So I request you to have a small look at  this.
